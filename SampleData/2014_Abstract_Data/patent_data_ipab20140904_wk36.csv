A voltage is applied to one or both drive ends of a NAND string to pre-charge a channel to a level which is sufficient to create gate-induced drain leakage at the select gate transistors. With timing based on a storage element's distance from the driven end, the control gate voltage is lowered to encourage tunneling of holes into a charge trapping layer in the erase period. The lowered control gate voltage results in a channel-to-control gate voltage which is sufficiently high to encourage tunneling. The duration of the erase period is also increased when the distance from the driven end is greater. As a result, a narrow erase distribution can be achieved."

As one example, the upper tail of the erase distribution is measured after programming. The higher the upper tail, the shallower the next erase, in one embodiment. This helps to improve endurance. In one embodiment, the erase depth is adjusted by determining a suitable erase verify level. Rather than (or in addition to) adjusting the erase verify level, the number of erase pulses that are performed after erase verify passes can be adjusted to adjust the erase depth."

US,20140247670,14278351,Pre-Charge During Programming For 3D Memory Using Gate-Induced Drain Leakage,"In a programming operation of a 3D stacked non-volatile memory device, the channel of an inhibited NAND string is pre-charged by gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) to achieve a high level of boosting which prevents program disturb in inhibited storage elements. In a program-verify iteration, prior to applying a program pulse, the drain-side select gate transistor is reverse biased to generate GIDL, causing the channel to be boosted to a pre-charge level such as 1.5V. Subsequently, when the program pulse is applied to a selected word line and pass voltages are applied to unselected word lines, the channel is boosted higher from the pre-charge level due to capacitive coupling. The pre-charge is effective even for a NAND string that is partially programmed because it does not rely on directly driving the channel from the bit line end."

US,20140249042,14172429,DETECTION OF BIOAGENTS USING A SHEAR HORIZONTAL SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE BIOSENSOR,"Viruses and other bioagents are of high medical and biodefense concern and their detection at concentrations well below the threshold necessary to cause health hazards continues to be a challenge with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity. Ideally, assays for accurate and real time detection of viral agents and other bioagents would not necessitate any pre-processing of the analyte, which would make them applicable for example to bodily fluids (blood, sputum) and man-made as well as naturally occurring bodies of water (pools, rivers). We describe herein a robust biosensor that combines the sensitivity of surface acoustic waves (SAW) generated at a frequency of 325 MHz with the specificity provided by antibodies and other ligands for the detection of viral agents. In preferred embodiments, a lithium tantalate based SAW transducer with silicon dioxide waveguide sensor platform featuring three test and one reference delay lines was used to adsorb antibodies directed against Coxsackie virus B4 or the negative-stranded category A bioagent Sin Nombre virus (SNV), a member of the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae, negative-stranded RNA viruses. Rapid detection (within seconds) of increasing concentrations of viral particles was linear over a range of order of magnitude for both viruses, although the sensor was approximately 50×10-fold more sensitive for the detection of SNV. For both pathogens, the sensor's selectivity for its target was not compromised by the presence of confounding Herpes Simplex virus type 1. The biosensor was able to detect SNV at doses lower than the load of virus typically found in a human patient suffering from hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Further, in a proof-of-principle real world application, the SAW biosensor was capable of selectively detecting SNV agents in complex solutions, such as naturally occurring bodies of water (river, sewage effluent) without analyte pre-processing."
