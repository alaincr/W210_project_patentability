<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a component supply device which is provided with a component support section for supporting multiple components in a scattered state.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a known component supply device, multiple components, which are discharged from an opening of a storage section which stores the multiple components, are scattered on a component support section, and the components are supplied in the next step through the operation of a component holding robot or the like from the component support section. An example of such a component supply device is described in the following patent literature.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">PTL 1: JP-A-10-202569</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the component supply device which is described in the above patent literature, when exchanging the type or the like of the components to be supplied, the operation of the device is stopped, and after removing the components from the storage section, it is necessary to store a new type of component in the storage section. Therefore, in order to exchange the components, the work of supplying the components may be stopped and the working efficiency may be lowered. A component exchange work may not be easily performed. The invention is made in consideration of such circumstances, and an object of the invention is to provide a component supply device capable of easily performing component exchange work, and capable of performing the exchanging of the components without stopping the work of supplying the components.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to solve the problem described above, a component supply device described in the invention includes a storage section which stores multiple components, a mounting section to which the storage section is mounted, and, a component support section which supports, in a scattered state, multiple components which are discharged from an opening of the storage section which is in a state of being mounted to the mounting section, in which the storage section is attachable and detachable in relation to the mounting section.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the component supply device described in the invention, the storage section which stores multiple components is attachable and detachable in relation to the mounting section. Therefore, when the components of a next step are being supplied from the component support section through an operation of a component holding robot or the like, for example, it is possible to remove the storage section from the mounting section and to attach a component storage section in which a new type of component is stored to the mounting section. Accordingly, it becomes possible to perform exchanging of components without stopping work of supplying the components. Performing the component exchange work becomes easy.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="2">(i) Component Storage Device</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The component storage device <b>100</b> is substantially a rectangular parallelepiped shape, and an upper face and the front face are opened. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b> is divided into a charging section <b>110</b> and a storage section <b>112</b> by a pair of inclined surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. Specifically, the inclined surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are arranged such that the end portions face each other, and the inclined surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are inclined such that the end portions which face each other are positioned at the bottom. The end portions which face each other of the inclined surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are separated, and an opening <b>114</b> is formed between the end portions which face each other of the inclined surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. The grade of an inclined surface <b>106</b> which is positioned at the front face side at which the component storage device <b>100</b> is open is gentler than the grade of the inclined surface <b>108</b>, and the end portion of the opening <b>114</b> side of the inclined surface <b>106</b> is positioned above the end portion of the opening <b>114</b> side of the inclined surface <b>108</b>. The opening <b>114</b> is opened to be larger than the components which are housed in the component storage device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Due to this structure, when multiple components are charged into the charging section <b>110</b> from the open upper face of the component storage device <b>100</b>, the multiple components roll on the inclined surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, are moved from the opening <b>114</b>, and are stored in the storage section <b>112</b>. A bottom face of the storage section <b>112</b>, that is, the bottom face of the component storage device <b>100</b> is an inclined surface <b>116</b>, and is inclined toward the open front face of the component storage device <b>100</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="2">(ii) Housing</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the housing <b>102</b> includes a pair of side walls <b>120</b>. The pair of side walls <b>120</b> are substantially rectangular, and are arranged facing each other so as to interpose the component storage device <b>100</b>. A pair of protruding portions <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> which protrude in a square-bracket shape are formed on the end portion of the rear side of each of the side walls <b>120</b>. The pair of side walls <b>120</b> are joined by connecting members <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> on the protruding portions <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. The pair of side walls <b>120</b> are joined by a connecting rod <b>130</b> at the end portion of the front side, and are joined by a connecting rod <b>132</b> at the bottom end portion. The dimensions of the space between the pair of side walls <b>120</b> are slightly longer than the width of the component storage device <b>100</b> which is interposed between the pair of side walls <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A support shaft <b>134</b> is bridged across the pair of side walls <b>120</b> at a base end section of the protruding portion <b>122</b>, and the component storage device <b>100</b> is supported, to be capable of rocking, by the support shaft <b>134</b> at a bottom end portion on the rear side. In other words, the component storage device <b>100</b> rocks centered on the support shaft <b>134</b> in the inner portion of the housing <b>102</b>. A rod-shaped stopper <b>136</b> is bridged across the pair of side walls <b>120</b> at the top end portion, and a rod-shaped stopper <b>138</b> is bridged at the bottom end portion. Upward rocking of the component storage device <b>100</b> is restricted by the stopper <b>136</b>, and downward rocking of the component storage device <b>100</b> is restricted by the stopper <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A cutout portion <b>140</b> is formed on the front side of the side wall of the component storage device <b>100</b>, and a brush holding member <b>142</b> is bridged across the pair of side walls <b>120</b> so as to be positioned in the cutout portion <b>140</b>. Accordingly, the component storage device <b>100</b> rocks in the inner portion of the housing <b>102</b> without coming into contact with the brush holding member <b>142</b>. A brush <b>144</b> is fixed to the bottom end portion of the brush holding member <b>142</b> so as to extend downward. The brush <b>144</b> is formed in a plate shape, and the dimension in the width direction of the brush <b>144</b> which is formed in a plate shape is slightly smaller than the dimension in the width direction of the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b>. Accordingly, when the component storage device <b>100</b> rocks upward, the brush <b>144</b> moves relatively toward the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a component discharge member <b>150</b> is arranged, in a fixed manner, between the pair of side walls <b>120</b> so as to be positioned in front of the bottom end portion of the front face of the component storage device <b>100</b>. The component discharge member <b>150</b> includes an inclined plate <b>152</b>, and a pair of side plates (note that only one of the pair of side plates is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) <b>154</b> which are provided to stand at both end portions in the width direction of the inclined plate <b>152</b>. The inclined plate <b>152</b> is formed by three different inclined surfaces. First, a first inclined surface <b>156</b> which is closest to the component storage device <b>100</b> is inclined in the same direction as the inclined surface <b>116</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b>, and is inclined to the same extent as the inclined surface <b>116</b>. A second inclined surface <b>158</b> which is continuous with the first inclined surface <b>156</b> is inclined in the same direction as the first inclined surface <b>156</b>, and is inclined at a steeper angle than the first inclined surface <b>156</b>. A third inclined surface <b>160</b> which is continuous with the second inclined surface <b>158</b> is inclined in the same direction as the second inclined surface <b>158</b>, and is inclined substantially in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0000">(iii) Grip</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the grip <b>104</b> is formed by a fixed gripping member <b>170</b> and a movable gripping member <b>172</b>. The fixed gripping member <b>170</b> has a rectangular tubular shape, and one side face is open. The fixed gripping member <b>170</b> is fixed to the connecting member <b>128</b> at the top end portion and is fixed to the connecting member <b>126</b> at the bottom end portion in a state in which the opening side face faces the space between the pair of side walls <b>120</b>. The movable gripping member <b>172</b> also has a rectangular tubular shape, and one side face is open. The dimension in the width direction of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is slightly smaller than the dimension in the width direction of the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>. The movable gripping member <b>172</b> is fitted into the inner portion of the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> such that the side face on which the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is opened and the side face on which the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> is opened face each other.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">A support shaft <b>174</b> is bridged across the pair of side walls <b>120</b> at the protruding portion <b>122</b>, and the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is supported, to be capable of rocking, by the support shaft <b>174</b> at the bottom end portion. In other words, the movable gripping member <b>172</b> rocks around the bottom end portion, and the top end portion of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> approaches or separates from the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>. The movable gripping member <b>172</b> is joined to the rear face of the component storage device <b>100</b> at the top end portion by a connecting arm <b>176</b>. Therefore, the component storage device <b>100</b> also rocks together with the rocking of the movable gripping member <b>172</b>. In other words, when the top end portion of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> rocks in a direction separating from the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>, the component storage device <b>100</b> rocks downward. On the other hand, when the top end portion of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> rocks in a direction approaching the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>, the component storage device <b>100</b> rocks upward.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">A cutout portion <b>178</b> is formed on the side face of the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>. The cutout portion <b>178</b> is formed of a first cutout portion <b>180</b> which is cut out in a substantially horizontal direction from the open side face of the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> toward the inside, and a second cutout portion <b>182</b> which is cut out downward from the end portion of the inner portion side of the first cutout portion <b>180</b>. On the other hand, an engagement member <b>184</b> which engages with the cutout portion <b>178</b> is fixed to the side face of the movable gripping member <b>172</b>. A spring (not illustrated) is arranged in a compressed state between the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> and the movable gripping member <b>172</b>. Therefore, the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is biased in a direction separating from the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> by the elastic force of the spring. In this case, the engagement member <b>184</b> of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is engaged with the first cutout portion <b>180</b> of the cutout portion <b>178</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">In other words, in a normal state, the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is biased in a direction separating from the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>, and the top end portion of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> rocks in a direction separating from the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>. The component storage device <b>100</b> rocks downward, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the component storage device <b>100</b> comes into contact with the stopper <b>138</b>. In this case, the end portion of the front side of the inclined surface <b>116</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b> faces the end portion of the rear side of the first inclined surface <b>156</b> of the inclined plate <b>152</b> with almost no gap therebetween. When the component storage device <b>100</b> rocks downward, since the brush <b>144</b> does not move relatively toward the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b>, there is a large opening between the bottom end portion of the brush <b>144</b> and the inclined surface <b>116</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b>. Therefore, in a normal state, the components which are stored in the storage section <b>112</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b> roll out onto the upper face of the inclined plate <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">The component feeder <b>82</b> is attached to the frame <b>96</b> to be attachable and detachable. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the frame <b>96</b> includes a pair of side frame sections <b>190</b>. The pair of side frame sections <b>190</b> are substantially plate shaped, and are arranged to face each other in a state of being separated by a predetermined distance. The distance between the pair of side frame sections <b>190</b> is slightly longer than the dimension of the width direction of the component feeder <b>82</b>, that is, slightly longer than the distance between the pair of side walls <b>120</b>. Therefore, the component feeder <b>82</b> is inserted between the pair of side frame sections <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">An engaging pin <b>192</b> which protrudes toward the inner portion of the frame <b>96</b> is fixed to the inner wall surface of each of the side frame sections <b>190</b>.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a support member <b>200</b> of a longitudinal shape is fixed to the inner wall surface of each of the side frame sections <b>190</b> so as to extend in the front-rear direction. An inclined surface <b>202</b> which is inclined downward toward the front is formed on the end portion of the front side of the support member <b>200</b>. On the other hand, an engaging pin <b>206</b> is formed on the outer wall surface of each of the side walls <b>120</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b>. When the component feeder <b>82</b> is inserted between the pair of side frame sections <b>190</b>, the engaging pin <b>192</b> engages with the cutout portion <b>196</b>, and the engaging pin <b>206</b> is supported on the inclined surface <b>202</b> of the support member <b>200</b>. Accordingly, the component feeder <b>82</b> is positioned between the pair of side frame sections <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a frame main body section <b>210</b> is arranged under the connecting member <b>126</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b> which is positioned between the pair of side frame sections <b>190</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a pair of support blocks <b>212</b> are fixed to the upper face of the frame main body section <b>210</b> to line up in the width direction of the frame <b>96</b>. An engagement rod <b>214</b> is bridged across the pair of support blocks <b>212</b>. A claw member <b>216</b> is fixed to the bottom end portion of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> of the grip <b>104</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b>. The claw member <b>216</b> is substantially L shaped, and a bent distal end portion extends toward the engagement rod <b>214</b>. In a state in which the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is biased in a direction separating from the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> by the elastic force of the spring, that is, in a normal state, the distal end portion of the claw member <b>216</b> is engaged with the engagement rod <b>214</b>. Accordingly, the component feeder <b>82</b> is locked to the frame <b>96</b> in a state of being positioned between the pair of side frame sections <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053">In a case in which the operator grips the grip <b>104</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b>, the movable gripping member <b>172</b> approaches the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> against the elastic force of the spring. In this case, the claw member <b>216</b> which is fixed to the bottom end portion of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> rocks in a direction separating from the engagement rod <b>214</b>. Accordingly, the engagement of the claw member <b>216</b> to the engagement rod <b>214</b> is released. Therefore, by lifting the component feeder <b>82</b> in a state in which the operator is gripping the grip <b>104</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b>, the component feeder <b>82</b> is removed from the frame <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">An RFID (short for radio frequency identifier) <b>217</b> is arranged on the inside of the bottom end portion of the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> of the grip <b>104</b>. The RFID <b>217</b> transmits ID information by short-range wireless communication using radio waves, and information relating to the components which are supplied by the component feeder <b>82</b> is transmitted as the ID information. On the other hand, a receiver <b>218</b> which is capable of receiving the ID information which is transmitted from the RFID <b>217</b> is arranged on the upper face of the frame main body section <b>210</b>. Accordingly, in the bulk component supply device <b>32</b>, in a case in which the component feeder <b>82</b> is attached to the frame <b>96</b>, the ID information is received by the receiver <b>218</b>, and the components which are supplied from the component feeder <b>82</b> are collated based on the ID information.</p>

The work head <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> which holds the component moves above the circuit substrate <b>12</b>, corrects the error of the holding position of the circuit substrate <b>12</b>, the error of the holding position of the component, and the like, and mounts the component onto the circuit substrate <b>12</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0021" level="2">(a) Supply of Lead Component by Bulk Component Supply Device</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0081">In the bulk component supply device <b>32</b>, the lead component <b>410</b> is charged into the component storage device <b>100</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b> by the operator, and the charged lead component <b>410</b> is supplied in a state of being placed on the component receiving member <b>392</b> of the component carrier <b>388</b> through the operation of the component supply unit <b>98</b> and the component delivery device <b>90</b>. Specifically, the operator charges multiple lead components <b>410</b> of the same type from the opening on the upper face of the component storage device <b>100</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b> of an arbitrary component supply unit <b>98</b> among the five component supply units <b>98</b>. At this time, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the component support member <b>220</b> is moved to the retraction position below the component feeder <b>82</b> through the operation of the component support member moving device <b>222</b>, and the component collecting container <b>262</b> is positioned in front of the component feeder <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the lead components <b>410</b> which are charged from the opening in the upper face of the component storage device <b>100</b> fall from the charging section <b>110</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b> into the storage section <b>112</b> via the opening <b>114</b>. In this case, the lead components <b>410</b> which fall roll on the inclined surface <b>116</b> and spread out on the inclined surface <b>116</b>. If the lead components <b>410</b> block the opening <b>114</b> and the opening <b>114</b> enters a blocked state, the multiple lead components <b>410</b> charged from the opening in the upper face of the component storage device <b>100</b> assume a state of being stacked in bulk in the charging section <b>110</b>. Even in a case in which the lead components <b>410</b> which fall onto the inclined surface <b>116</b> exceed the inclined plate <b>152</b> and roll off, the lead components <b>410</b> are housed in the component collecting container <b>262</b> which is positioned in front of the component feeder <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0083">After the charging of the lead components <b>410</b> to the component storage device <b>100</b>, the component support member <b>220</b> is caused to move from under the component feeder <b>82</b> toward the front through the operation of the component support member moving device <b>222</b>. In this case, if the cam member <b>240</b> reaches the cam follower <b>242</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the roller <b>254</b> of the cam follower <b>242</b> is lifted along the inclined surface <b>246</b> of the teeth <b>245</b> of the cam member <b>240</b>. The roller <b>254</b> surpasses the teeth <b>245</b> on the vertical surface <b>248</b> of the teeth <b>245</b>. The lever <b>252</b> of the cam follower <b>242</b> is biased in a direction toward the front by the elastic force of a coil spring, and the biasing of the lever <b>252</b> to the front is restricted by the stopper <b>244</b>. Therefore, when the component support member <b>220</b> moves toward the front, the component support member <b>220</b> is maintained in a state in which the roller <b>254</b> meshes with the teeth <b>245</b>, the lever <b>252</b> does not rotate toward the front, and the roller <b>254</b> surpasses the teeth <b>245</b>. In this case, the component feeder <b>82</b> is lifted due to the surpassing of the teeth <b>245</b> of the roller <b>254</b>. In other words, in a state in which the roller <b>254</b> meshes with the teeth <b>245</b>, the component support member <b>220</b> moves toward the front, whereby the roller <b>254</b> surpasses the multiple teeth <b>245</b>, and the component feeder <b>82</b> continuously vibrates in the up-down direction.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0084">The lead components <b>410</b> which are spread out on the inclined surface <b>116</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b> moves to the front due to the vibration of the component feeder <b>82</b> and the inclination of the inclined surface <b>116</b>, and are discharged onto the upper face of the component support section <b>226</b> of the component support member <b>220</b> via the inclined plate <b>152</b>. In this case, the falling of the lead components <b>410</b> from the upper face of the component support section <b>226</b> is prevented by the leg sections <b>228</b> of the component support member <b>220</b>. Due to the vibration of the component feeder <b>82</b>, the lead components <b>410</b> which block the opening <b>114</b> fall onto the inclined surface <b>116</b> via the opening <b>114</b>, and are discharged onto the upper face of the component support section <b>226</b> via the inclined plate <b>152</b>. As the component support member <b>220</b> moves to the front, the area of the component support section <b>226</b> which are exposed from the bottom of the component feeder <b>82</b> increases, and the lead components <b>410</b> are sequentially discharged onto the component support section <b>226</b> corresponding to the increased area. At a timing at which the roller <b>254</b> surpasses the teeth <b>245</b>, the component feeder <b>82</b> vibrates, and the lead components <b>410</b> are discharged from the component feeder <b>82</b> onto the upper face of the component support section <b>226</b>. The cam member <b>240</b> is disengaged from the cam follower <b>242</b> before the component support member <b>220</b> reaches the component supply position. Therefore, when the cam member <b>240</b> is disengaged from the cam follower <b>242</b> and the component support member <b>220</b> moves to the component supply position, the component feeder <b>82</b> does not vibrate, and the lead components <b>410</b> are not discharged from the component feeder <b>82</b> onto the upper face of the component support section <b>226</b>. In this manner, in the component supply unit <b>98</b>, the multiple lead components <b>410</b> are scattered on the upper face of the component support section <b>226</b> in a state in which the component support member <b>220</b> reaches the component supply position.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0085">When the component support member <b>220</b> reaches the component supply position, the camera <b>290</b> of the imaging device <b>88</b> is caused to move above the component support section <b>226</b> on which the lead components <b>410</b> are scattered through the operation of the camera moving device <b>292</b>, and the camera <b>290</b> images the lead components <b>410</b>. Based on the captured image data, the multiple lead components <b>410</b> which are scattered on the upper face of the component support section <b>226</b> are divided into lead components (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;pickup target components&#x201d;) that can be picked up by the suction nozzle <b>332</b>, and a lead component (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;non-pickup target components&#x201d;) that may not be picked up by the suction nozzle <b>332</b>. Since the method of dividing the pickup target components from the non-pickup target components is not related to the invention, a brief description will be given. The lead components <b>410</b> which are in a state in which a surface difficult to suck such as an uneven surface faces upwards, the lead components <b>410</b> which are in a state in which the leads <b>414</b> are in contact with the upper face of the component support section <b>226</b> and are inclined, and the like are classified as non-pickup target components, and the other lead components <b>410</b> are classified as pickup target components. Information such as the position on the component support section <b>226</b>, the posture of the lead components <b>410</b>, and the like is acquired for the lead components <b>410</b> which are classified as the pickup target components based on the captured image data.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0086">The component holding head <b>302</b> is moved above the pickup target component through the operation of the component holding head moving device <b>300</b> based on the acquired positional information of the pickup target component, and the pickup target component is sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>332</b>. When the pickup target component is sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>332</b>, the suction nozzle <b>332</b> is positioned at the non-pivoting position.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0087">After the pickup target component is held by the suction nozzle <b>332</b>, the component holding head <b>302</b> is caused to move above the component carrier <b>388</b>, and, at this time, the component carrier <b>388</b> is caused to move to the component receiving position through the operation of the component carrier moving device <b>390</b>. When the component holding head <b>302</b> moves above the component carrier <b>388</b>, the suction nozzle <b>332</b> is caused to revolve to the pivoting position. However, since the revolving direction of the suction nozzle <b>332</b> is a single direction, the leads <b>414</b> of the lead component <b>410</b> which is held by the suction nozzle <b>332</b> at the pivoting position may face downward in the vertical direction. Therefore, in order that the leads <b>414</b> of the lead component <b>410</b> which is held by the suction nozzle <b>332</b> at the pivoting position faces downward in the vertical direction, the holding posture by the suction nozzle <b>332</b> is calculates based on the posture information of the pickup target component on the component support section <b>226</b>. The suction nozzle <b>332</b> is caused to rotate by the nozzle rotation device <b>336</b> before holding the pickup target component such that the pickup target component may be held with the calculated holding posture. Accordingly, the lead component <b>410</b> which is held by the suction nozzle <b>332</b> of the pivoting position enters a state in which leads <b>414</b> face downward in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0088">When the component holding head <b>302</b> is caused to move above the component carrier <b>388</b>, the lead component <b>410</b> which is in a state in which the leads <b>414</b> face downward in the vertical direction is inserted into the component receiving member <b>392</b> along the guide surface <b>426</b>. In this case, the lead component <b>410</b> is placed on the component receiving member <b>392</b> in a state in which the leads <b>414</b> face downward in the vertical direction. The component carrier <b>388</b> moves to the component supply position through the operation of the component carrier moving device <b>390</b>. Since the component carrier <b>388</b> which is moved to the component supply position is positioned in the movement range of the work heads <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, the lead component <b>410</b> is supplied at this position in the bulk component supply device <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the lead component <b>410</b> which is placed on the component receiving member <b>392</b> of the component carrier <b>388</b> at the component supply position is held by the component holding tools <b>66</b> of the work heads <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>. In this manner, in the bulk component supply device <b>32</b>, the lead component <b>410</b> is supplied in a state in which the leads <b>414</b> face downward, and the surface facing the surface to which the leads <b>414</b> are connected faces upward. Therefore, the component holding head <b>302</b> becomes capable of appropriately holding the lead component <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0089">The movement range of the component holding head <b>302</b> by the component holding head moving device <b>300</b>, and the movement range of the camera <b>290</b> by the camera moving device <b>292</b> are different from each other, as described above. Therefore, each time the pickup target component is picked up by the component holding head <b>302</b>, the camera <b>290</b> is capable of obtaining the positional information of the pickup target component in a state of being positioned above the component support member <b>220</b>. Specifically, the lead component <b>410</b> on the component support member <b>220</b> is imaged by the camera <b>290</b> which is positioned above the component support member <b>220</b>. Based on the captured image data, the work of picking up is performed by the component holding head <b>302</b>, and the pickup target component which is picked up is placed on the component receiving member <b>392</b>. In this case, the component holding head <b>302</b> is moved over the component carrier <b>388</b> of the shuttle device <b>304</b>, and is not positioned above the component support member <b>220</b>. Therefore, the lead component <b>410</b> on the component support member <b>220</b> is imaged by the camera <b>290</b> at a timing at which the component holding head <b>302</b> is moved to above the component carrier <b>388</b>. The work of picking up a new pickup target component is performed by the component holding head <b>302</b> based on the captured image data. Accordingly, it becomes possible to perform the work of picking up based on the newest information, and it becomes possible to secure appropriate pickup work.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="2">(b) Collection of Lead Components to Component Storage Device</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0090">When the work of picking up the pickup target components that are scattered on the component support member <b>220</b> advances, many non-pickup target components remain on the component support member <b>220</b>. In such a case, the lead components <b>410</b> on component support member <b>220</b> are returned to the component storage device <b>100</b> through the operation of the component returning device <b>86</b>. Specifically, when the lead components <b>410</b> are returned to the component storage device <b>100</b>, first, the component support member <b>220</b> is caused to move toward to the bottom of the component feeder <b>82</b> through the operation of the component support member moving device <b>222</b>. In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the lead component <b>410</b> on the component support member <b>220</b> is blocked by the third inclined surface <b>160</b> of the inclined plate <b>152</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b>. Therefore, when the component support member <b>220</b> moves toward the bottom of the component feeder <b>82</b>, the lead component <b>410</b> on the component support member <b>220</b> moves forward relative to the component support member <b>220</b>, and is scraped off into the inner portion of the component collecting container <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0091">When the component support member <b>220</b> moves to the bottom of the component feeder <b>82</b>, a force in the same direction as the movement direction of the component support member <b>220</b> acts on the cam follower <b>242</b> from the cam member <b>240</b>, and, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the lever <b>252</b> of the cam follower <b>242</b> rotates against the elastic force of the coil spring. Therefore, when the roller <b>254</b> of the cam follower <b>242</b> surpasses the teeth <b>245</b> of the cam member <b>240</b>, the lever <b>252</b> rotates and the component feeder <b>82</b> does not vibrate. Accordingly, when the component support member <b>220</b> moves toward the bottom of the component feeder <b>82</b>, the lead component <b>410</b> is not discharged from the component storage device <b>100</b> to the component support member <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0092">After the component support member <b>220</b> moves below the component feeder <b>82</b>, that is, after the component support member <b>220</b> moves to the retraction position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the component collecting container <b>262</b> is lifted through the operation of the container lifting and lowering device <b>260</b>. In this case, as the component collecting container <b>262</b> is lifted, the shutter <b>265</b> is lifted due to the elastic force of the coil spring <b>282</b>, and blocks the front of the inclined plate <b>152</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Accordingly, the discharging of the lead components <b>410</b> from the component feeder <b>82</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0093">When the component collecting container <b>262</b> is further lifted, the protruding pin <b>272</b> which is arranged on the component collecting container <b>262</b> engages with the engaging block <b>274</b> which is arranged on the inside of the side frame section <b>190</b>. Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the component collecting container <b>262</b> rotates. In this case, the bottom face of the component collecting container <b>262</b> becomes vertical, and the wall surface of the component storage device <b>100</b> side of the component collecting container <b>262</b> becomes an inclined surface which is inclined toward the component storage device <b>100</b>. Therefore, the lead components <b>410</b> inside the component collecting container <b>262</b> are all returned to the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0094">When the lead component <b>410</b> is returned to the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b>, it is possible to perform the work of supplying the lead components <b>410</b> in the other component supply unit <b>98</b> from the component supply unit <b>98</b> in which the work of returning the lead components <b>410</b> is being performed. Specifically, when the cam follower <b>242</b> is engaged with the cam member <b>240</b> and the component feeder <b>82</b> is vibrating, the lead components <b>410</b> are discharged onto the component support member <b>220</b>. Therefore, the lead components <b>410</b> are scattered on the upper face of a side of the component support member <b>220</b> which is separated from the component feeder <b>82</b>, that is, the front side. On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the component collecting container <b>262</b> is lifted at the position closest to the component feeder <b>82</b>, and the lead components <b>410</b> inside the component collecting container <b>262</b> are returned to the component storage device <b>100</b>. Therefore, even if the work of picking up the lead components <b>410</b> on the component support member <b>220</b> of the other component supply unit <b>98</b> from the component supply unit <b>98</b> in which the work of returning the lead components <b>410</b> is being performed, the component holding head <b>302</b> does not interfere with the component collecting container <b>262</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to simultaneously perform the work of returning the lead components <b>410</b> in the predetermined component supply unit <b>98</b>, and the work of supplying the lead components <b>410</b> in the different component supply unit <b>98</b> from the predetermined component supply unit <b>98</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="2">(c) Exchanging of Lead Components</heading>
<p id="p-0098" num="0095">When the circuit substrate <b>12</b> as the production target is changed, it is necessary to replace the lead components <b>410</b> to be supplied. In such a case, the component feeder <b>82</b> is removed from the frame <b>96</b>, and the component feeder <b>82</b> corresponding to a new type of the lead component <b>410</b> is mounted on the frame <b>96</b>. Specifically, after the lead components <b>410</b> on the component support member <b>220</b> are returned to the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b>, the operator grips the grip <b>104</b> of the component feeder <b>82</b>, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is caused to rock toward the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>. In this case, the engagement member <b>184</b> of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> proceeds to the inner portion of the first cutout portion <b>180</b> of the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>. When the engagement member <b>184</b> reaches the top end of the second cutout portion <b>182</b>, the engagement member <b>184</b> drops to the bottom end of the second cutout portion <b>182</b> due to the weight of the component feeder <b>82</b>. Accordingly, the engagement of the claw member <b>216</b> which is attached to the bottom end of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> to the engagement rod <b>214</b> is released, and it becomes possible to remove the component feeder <b>82</b> from the frame <b>96</b>, that is, from between the pair of side frame sections <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0096">When the grip <b>104</b> is gripped and the movable gripping member <b>172</b> rocks toward the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>, the component storage device <b>100</b> rocks toward the rear around the support shaft <b>134</b> in the inner portion of the housing <b>102</b>. In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the end portion of the front side of the inclined surface <b>116</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b> approaches or comes into contact with the distal end portion of the brush <b>144</b>. Accordingly, it becomes possible to prevent the lead components <b>410</b> from being discharged from the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b> when the component feeder <b>82</b> is removed from the frame <b>96</b>. Even in a case in which the lead components <b>410</b> are jammed between the brush <b>144</b> and the inclined surface <b>116</b>, it is possible to prevent breakage of the lead components <b>410</b> through the elastic deformation of the brush <b>144</b>. Furthermore, since the engagement member <b>184</b> of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> is dropped onto the bottom end of the second cutout portion <b>182</b> of the fixed gripping member <b>170</b>, after the operator removes the component feeder <b>82</b> from the frame <b>96</b>, even if the hand is released from the grip <b>104</b>, the movable gripping member <b>172</b> does not rock due to the elastic force of the spring, and the position of the component storage device <b>100</b> is maintained. Therefore, even in a case in which the operator releases the hand from the grip <b>104</b> after the operator removes the component feeder <b>82</b> from the frame <b>96</b>, the inclined surface <b>116</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b> and the distal end portion of the brush <b>144</b> are close or in contact with each other, thereby preventing the lead components <b>410</b> from being discharged from the inner portion of the component storage device <b>100</b>.</p>

Accordingly, the component feeder <b>82</b> is positioned between the pair of side frame sections <b>190</b>. Due to the operator moving the engagement member <b>184</b> of the grip <b>104</b> from the bottom end to the top end of the second cutout portion <b>182</b>, the movable gripping member <b>172</b> rocks in a direction separating from the fixed gripping member <b>170</b> due to the elastic force of the spring. In this case, the claw member <b>216</b> which is attached to the bottom end portion of the movable gripping member <b>172</b> engages with the engagement rod <b>214</b>.

In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the end portion of the front side of the inclined surface <b>116</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b> moves downward, and the space between the distal end portion of the brush <b>144</b> and the inclined surface <b>116</b> is opened. Accordingly, it becomes possible to discharge the lead components <b>410</b> which are charged into the component storage device <b>100</b> from the storage section <b>112</b>. In this manner, in the bulk component supply device <b>32</b>, it becomes possible to easily exchange the lead components <b>410</b> to be supplied by exchanging the component feeders <b>82</b>.</p>

A new type of lead component <b>410</b> is charged into the component feeder <b>82</b> from the inner portion of which all the lead components <b>410</b> are removed, and the component feeder <b>82</b>, which is in the state in which a new type of lead component <b>410</b> is stored in the inner portion, may be mounted to the frame <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0102">In the example described above, as the component storage device <b>100</b> rocks in the inner portion of the housing <b>102</b>, the opening for discharging the lead components <b>410</b> of the component storage device <b>100</b> is closed by the brush <b>144</b>. In other words, at the timing at which the locking of the component feeder <b>82</b> to the frame <b>96</b> is released, the opening of the component storage device <b>100</b> is closed by the brush <b>144</b>; however, it is possible to close the opening of the component storage device <b>100</b> at an arbitrary timing. Specifically, for example, a closing member such as a shutter is arranged so as to be capable of sliding between an open position for opening the opening of the component storage device <b>100</b> and a close position for closing the opening. The closing member is caused to slide through the operation of an actuator such as an electromagnetic motor. Accordingly, it is possible to close the opening of the component storage device <b>100</b> at an arbitrary timing.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0103">In the example described above, information relating to the lead components <b>410</b> which are supplied by the component feeder <b>82</b> is transmitted as identification information by the RFID <b>217</b>; however, it is possible to transmit information relating to the component feeder <b>82</b>. In this case, the information relating to the component feeder <b>82</b> and the information relating to the lead components <b>410</b> which are supplied by the component feeder <b>82</b> are stored in association with each other in the bulk component supply device <b>32</b>, and the information relating to the lead components <b>410</b> which are supplied by the component feeder <b>82</b> is extracted based on the received information relating to the component feeder <b>82</b>. The collation of the components is performed based on the extracted information. It is possible to record the identification information in a bar code, a 2D code, or the like, and to write the bar code, the 2D code, or the like in the component feeder <b>82</b>. In this case, the identification information is read using a code reader or the like.</p>
