<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed is the redirection of air flow in a sub-plenum using a multi-directional plume that is attached to the bottom surface of an air-grate floor panel. The air-grate floor panel <b>102 </b>has openings which allow redirected air to flow in an upward direction to cool computer equipment, including servers. The multi-directional plume has a series of vanes that are disposed in various different directions to deflect a flow of air conditioning air through a sub-plenum in a vertical direction to flow through openings in the air-grate floor panel. Since the multi-directional plume is capable of redirecting air from various different directions in the sub-plenum, the air-grate floor panels do not have to be repositioned to capture air flow from any particular direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The term &#x201c;sub-plenum&#x201d; means that portion of the computer room below the air-grate floor panels when installed on a pedestal support system. The term &#x201c;upper plenum&#x201d; means that portion of the computer room above the air-grate floor panels, including the data processing server equipment and in-row air conditioners, or air handling units. Thus, the term &#x201c;computer room&#x201d; means the overall air handling environment including the upper and sub plenums from the subfloor to the ceiling. Finally, &#x201c;CRAC units&#x201d; means those computer room air conditioning units typically located at the perimeter of the data center floor surrounding the (server) racks, or in-rows, to circulate air in the data center space to create a cooling loop.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Raised floor systems are used in data centers to create a sub-plenum space between the subfloor, of a building, and the normal operating environment of the computer room. The sub-plenum space is used for circulating cooling air to the computer servers. Perforations in the top plates, of air-grate floor panels, are configured to enhance the circulation of cooling air through the raised floor. Air-grate floor panels use an open-box load bearing frame. The open-box frame is designed with longitudinally spaced apart vertical girder plates, and transverse vertical reinforcing rib plates, in a crisscrossed assembly, for supporting the load.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Manufacturers of raised floor panels have engaged in the redesign and development of the open box sub-frame to include girder plates which are configured with a lower vaned face, which acts to redirect a tangential cooling airflow, originating in the sub-plenum, upwardly, through the open air-grate perforations in the top plate with an object of enhancing cooling efficiency to the server cabinets. One such design, which has gained side acceptance in the industry, is the open box sub-frame disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. D567,398, entitled &#x201c;Floor Panel Superstructure,&#x201d; issued Apr. 22, 2008, to Meyer, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference for all that it discloses and teaches. There, it is ordinarily observed that the supporting girder plates, of the open box subframe, include lower inclined airfoils that are capable of capture and redirection of a tangential flow of cooling air. It can be appreciated that a fluid dynamic, inherent in use of this design, would result in an increase in the volume and directional velocity of the cooling air flowing from the sub-plenum and into the upper plenum, of a computer room, through the slotted perforations in the air-grate floor panel top plate. This increase in velocity enhances cooling efficiency, and further promotes the creation of an air separation barrier within the computer room.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another such example is the air grate floor panel sub-plenum retrofit airfoil disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,217,252, to Meyer. There, it is ordinarily observed a retrofit airfoil for attachment to at least one of the girder members of an open-box load bearing frame supporting an air-grate raised access floor panel. The open box frame includes a plurality of longitudinally spaced apart vertical girder-plate members and a plurality of longitudinally spaced apart transverse vertical reinforcing rib-plate members. The airfoil includes a sheet. The sheet has an upper edge, a lower edge, and a horizontal bend formation positioned along a longitudinal axis established therebetween. The bend formation defines an upper vertical face, and a lower inclined face.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An embodiment of the invention may therefore comprise, in a raised floor system, a method for redirection of an omni-directional tangential sub-plenum airflow, comprising: providing an air-grate raised floor panel having an upper surface, a lower surface and at least one open air flow duct portion extending therethrough; providing an anterior air-flow plume attachment, the attachment being a sheet configured with a plurality of downwardly projection tangential air-flow capturing vane members, the vane members defining corresponding open air-flow channel portions; attaching a top wall of the top plate of the anterior air-flow plume adjacent to the lower surface of the air-grate raised floor panel; installing the air-grate floor panel on a raised floor pedestal support system; supplying a sub-plenum of the raised floor pedestal support system with the tangential air-flow; and using the anterior air-flow plume attachment to redirect the tangential air-flow through the duct portion without repositioning the installed air-grate floor panel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An embodiment of the invention may further comprise an omni-directional airflow plenum for attachment to the anterior of a raised floor air-grate panel comprising: a sheet having a pattern established to form a plurality of predetermined cut out formations, the formations defining a plurality of air redirecting vanes and open air flow channels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment of the invention may further comprise a method of redirecting air in a sub-plenum of a raised floor system having air-grate floor panels comprising: providing a multi-directional plume that has a plurality of vanes that are directed in at least two different directions at an angle from a surface of the multi-directional plume, and openings in the surface of the multi-directional plume adjacent the vanes; attaching the multi-directional plume to a lower surface of the air-grate floor panels so that the plurality of vanes extend below the air-grate floor panels and the multi-directional plume in the sub-plenum of the raised floor system and are disposed in at least two different directions to redirect air that is flowing in the sub-plenum towards openings in the air-grate floor panels when the air-grate floor panels are installed in the raised floor system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An embodiment of the invention may further comprise a system for redirecting sub-plenum air of a sub-plenum in a raised floor system comprising: an air-grate floor panel having an open box load bearing frame and a top plate having openings that allow air to pass through the air-grate floor panel; a multi-directional plume having a plurality of vanes that are directed in at least two different directions that form an angle with a surface of the multi-directional plume so that the plurality of vanes extend outwardly from the surface; connectors disposed on the multi-directional plume that connect the multi-directional plume to the air-grate floor panel such that the plurality of vanes extend outwardly into the sub-plenum when the air-grate floor panel and the multi-directional plume are disposed in the raised floor system and redirect air flowing in the sub-plenum through the openings in the top plate of the air-grate floor panel.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an isometric view of a multi-directional plume <b>100</b> that can be detachably deployed on an air-grate floor panel <b>102</b>. The multi-directional plume <b>100</b> has a series of vanes <b>106</b> that are deployed in six different directions to redirect air in the sub-plenum of a raised floor toward the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b>. The air-grate floor panel <b>102</b> has a series of openings that cause the air from an air conditioning unit to be directed upwardly onto servers and other computer equipment that may be disposed in various types of computer rooms, including, but not limited to, large data centers. The multi-directional plume <b>100</b> has a plurality of attachment connectors, such as attachment connector <b>104</b>. The attachment connector <b>104</b> may comprise any type of connector that is capable of connecting the multi-directional plume <b>100</b> to the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b> and the various girder plates and reinforcing rib plates on the open box air-grate floor panel <b>102</b>. This is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 9,217,252, entitled &#x201c;Air-Grate Floor Panel Sub-Plenum Retrofit Airfoil,&#x201d; issued Dec. 22, 2015, to Gary Meyer, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference for all that it discloses and teaches. A retainer clip <b>19</b> is disclosed in the above-identified patent, which can be used as an attachment connector <b>104</b>. Additionally, the attachment connector <b>104</b> may comprise a member that can be screwed, glued, or otherwise attached to portions of the bottom surface of the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b>. The attachment connector <b>104</b> can include any type of attachment device, including rivets, hooks, loop fasteners, clips, grooves, magnetic connectors, or any desired type of connector.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In practice, embodiments of the present invention improve the capture of sub-plenum cooling air, supplied via in-row CRAC units, and redirects the captured cooling air upwardly through the top plate of the raised floor air-grate to enhance cooling efficiency to the computer servers in the upper plenum of the computer room.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic representation of an embodiment of a raised floor system <b>126</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the raised floor system is supported by pedestals, such as pedestals <b>128</b>, and support frame <b>130</b>. The air-grate floor panels <b>102</b> are placed in the openings of the support frames <b>130</b> and are supported by the support frame <b>130</b> and pedestals <b>128</b> in a raised position over a subfloor. The area between the subfloor and the air-grate floor panels <b>102</b> is referred to as the sub-plenum <b>138</b>. In computer rooms, air conditioning is supplied to the sub-plenum <b>138</b>, so that cold air flows through openings <b>140</b> in the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b> to cool the computer equipment, including servers from the air-grate floor panels <b>102</b>. Since cool air rises, the cool air from the air conditioning flows past the computer equipment and provides an efficient manner of cooling the computer equipment. To increase the efficiency of the air flowing upwardly through the openings <b>140</b> in the air-grate floor panels <b>102</b>, it is beneficial to provide a plume, such as multi-directional plume <b>100</b>, that is attached to the bottom of the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b>. The multi-directional plume <b>100</b> has vanes <b>106</b>, which redirect the air in an upward direction from the sub-plenum <b>138</b>. The air conditioning ducts are normally disposed on the outside walls and direct the air in various directions in the sub-plenum <b>138</b>. For example, the air conditioning air flow can be directed as shown by arrows <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, as well as other directions. The air flow direction may be in a single direction, or multiple directions, depending upon the installation of the air conditioning ducts. It is therefore beneficial to have a multi-directional plume <b>100</b> that can redirect air from various different directions to flow upwardly through the air-grate floor panels <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a top view of an embodiment of the multi-directional plume <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the multi-directional plume <b>100</b> has a plurality of vanes that are formed in the plate <b>101</b>. The plate <b>101</b> can comprise various different materials, such as metal, plastic, polymer, composite materials, or any desired material that can function as a plume. The multi-directional plume can be injection molded or blow molded. The plume <b>101</b> may be made from a sheet of metal, which can be laser cut, so that the vanes <b>106</b> can be deflected and bent in a direction to deflect the air in the sub-plenum. A deflection of the vanes <b>106</b> leaves the openings <b>108</b> for air to flow through to the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b>. The particular design and arrangement of the vanes <b>106</b> is arranged to maximize the capture of air flow in the direction shown by arrows <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>. Of course, air flow in slightly different directions is also captured by the vanes <b>106</b> of the multi-directional plume <b>100</b>. In this manner, the multi-directional plume <b>100</b> can be placed on the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b> and capture air flow from the air conditioning in the sub-plenum in multiple directions. As such, the particular orientation of the air-grate floor panel in the raised floor system is not of concern and the air-grate floor panels <b>102</b> can be disposed in any of the four different directions in the raised floor system <b>126</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a side view of the multi-directional plume <b>100</b> illustrating the attachment connectors <b>104</b> and vanes <b>106</b>. The side view from each of the directions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is identical because of the symmetrical nature of the multi-directional plume <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is a side view of the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the air-grate floor panel is aligned with the multi-directional plume <b>100</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, so that the attachment connectors <b>104</b> can attach to the various structural members of the air-grate floor panel <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic bottom view of the multi-directional plume <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vanes <b>106</b> protrude in a downward direction and leave openings <b>108</b> for air that is deflected by the vanes <b>106</b> to travel in an upward direction toward the air-grate floor panels and flow through the openings in the air-grate floor panels. Of course, any particular design of the orientation of the vanes <b>106</b> can be used, although the six different directions, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, provide a large coverage of directions of air flow. In that regard, various numbers of directions, such as two directions, four directions, eight directions, ten directions, or more, or even odd numbers of directions can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic isometric view of another embodiment of an air vane system that captures air flowing from multiple different directions. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, vanes <b>122</b> are individual vanes that are attached directly to the structural members of the air-grate floor panel <b>124</b>. Again, the attachment can be made in any desired manner, as disclosed above. The individual vanes <b>122</b> may have an aerodynamic shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to deflect air from various flow directions. The curved shape of the vanes <b>122</b> allows air to be captured efficiently from substantially all directions, which is enhanced by the aerodynamic shape of the vanes <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the various embodiments of the present invention provide retrofits for air-grate floor panels that deflect air from a sub-plenum area in multiple directions without the need to either reposition the floor panels, or redirect the flow of air in the sub-plenum.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The foregoing description is considered as illustrative of the principles of the invention. Furthermore, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and process shown and described above. Accordingly, resort may be made to all suitable modifications and equivalents that fall within the scope of the invention. The words &#x201c;comprise,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;include,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;includes&#x201d; when used in this specification are intended to specify the presence of stated features, integers, components, or steps, but they do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, components, steps, or groups thereof.</p>
