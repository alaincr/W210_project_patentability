This is the doc2vec model directory

requirements.txt has all the python imports needed

The cluster CSV files need to be present in the CSV directory
So do the following
mkdir CSV
Copy all the cluster CSV files to CSV directory

Connect to python (ipython)

There is one script
W210_Tensorflow_Cosine_Similarity.ipynb --> Python script that reads the CSV files and generates the TF model for selected cluster .  Cosine similarity is calcualted and topn documents will be printed
An example csv file is given patent_data_2wks.csv

The script has a variable which defines whether we are going to use the patent_data_2wks.csv or the cluster CSV file.  
The script defaults to patent_data_2wks.csv
If the user goes with the default, the scrit will ask for the following user input
1.  New claims text
2.  topn documents to display

If the user decides to use the cluster files, then the script will ask for the following user input
1.  New claims text
2.  Top cluster number (0->9)
3.  Sub-cluster number (0->9)
4.  topn documents to display
