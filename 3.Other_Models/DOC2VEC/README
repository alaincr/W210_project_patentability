This is the doc2vec model directory

requirements.txt has all the python imports needed

The cluster CSV files need to be present in the CSV directory
So do the following
mkdir CSV
Copy all the cluster CSV files to CSV directory
mkdir MODELS --> This is where the doc2vec models will be stored upon generation

Connect to python (ipython)

There are two scripts
W210_Patent_Doc2Vec.ipynb --> Python script that reads the CSV files and generates the doc2vec models for each cluster (stored in the MODELS directory)

After the models are generated run the following script
W210_Patent_Doc2vec_cosine_similarity.ipynb --> to generate cosine similarity between new claim and claims in the selected top-cluster/subcluster

The script will ask for the following user input
1.  New claims text
2.  Top cluster number (0->9)
3.  Sub-cluster number (0->9)
4.  topn documents to display
