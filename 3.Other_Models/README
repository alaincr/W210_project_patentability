This directory consists of all the deprecated models that did not make the final cut for the project

The models are
1.  DOC2VEC --> gensim doc2vec model
2.  SPACY -> spacy model for cosine similarity
3.  TENSORFLOW -> TF model for cosine similarity

Each model flow follows the same steps.

Generate the models based on the cluster CSV files that were pregenerated from the USPTO data
Train the model with variables from the CSV file (application patent number, stemmed claims text)
Ask user to enter new claim
Perform Cosine similarity between new claim and the claims that are already part of the dataset
Print the topn claims based on cosine similarity
